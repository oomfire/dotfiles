# dotfiles

These are just my dotfiles on vanilla Arch and uses Polybar and Rofi

Influences:  Arcolinux, Archbang, Archcraft


Herbstluft:  LOVE this wm.  Hoping people might find my keybinds logical and clutter free.

i3:  Really nothing special here.  Just some keyboard shortcuts.  Quite vanilla.

Openbox:  Some handy keys to handle screen quadrants but I make no real effort to pseudotile here.  I let this one get cluttered as it was the first window manager I got playing with.
